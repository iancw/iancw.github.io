<p>(Thoughts prompted by http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/07/02/03/2147222.shtml )</p>

<blockquote>Discipline coding makes a difference. Automated unit testing catches most problems, and regression testing finds almost all the rest, and not everybody does these things.</p></blockquote>
<p>I immediately think "we don't do these things," because when I started here I was told that we did but found, over time, that we actually don't and when we try we do it wrong.  So, how do you use automated unit testing and regressions tests to improve software reliability.  What is disciplined coding?  Can proper methods insure good software?  Obviously not.  How much do they actually help.  How do you teach someone to develop good software?  I'm asking because I don't know.  I don't know how to teach it, and I don't know how to do it.  I work with a group of people who mostly share my position; fresh from school, desperately needing to understand good development practices, but without any place to glean that understanding from.</p>
<p>So, how do you use unit tests to catch problems?</p>
<p>And how to do you regression test?</p>
<p>Also look into these:<br />- Life cycle of a project,<br />- Gantt and Pert diagrams,<br />- Risk management,<br />- Ishikawa diagrams,<br />- Code complexity,<br />- Software quality assurance,<br />- Coding style standards,<br />- Documentation standards,<br />- Software patterns...</p>
