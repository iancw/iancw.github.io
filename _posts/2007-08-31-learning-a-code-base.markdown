<p>How is it done?  That's the question I've been asking myself for the past two years.  One thing that hasn't worked for me when I see hundreds of classes arrainged in an incomprehensable package structure is to panic.  Understand before you re-write seems like a good rule of thumb.  I also think there's no substitude for reading every class top-to-bottom.  One technique I've tried to use recently is to search for a sub-system's 'gateways,' or interfaces, into the rest of the system.  A big part of that is understanding what the subsystems are.</p>
