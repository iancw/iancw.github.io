<p>To enable the most critical emacs shortcuts, put this in ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBindings.dict</p>
<blockquote><p>{<br />
"~f" = "moveWordForward:";<br />
"~b" = "moveWordBackward:";<br />
"~d" = "deleteWordForward:";<br />
}</p></blockquote>
<p>You also probably want to turn on Option key as Meta in the Terminal preferences.<br />
