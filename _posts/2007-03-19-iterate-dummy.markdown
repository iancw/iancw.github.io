<p>After spending an entire week <span style="font-style:italic;">alone<&#47;span>, if you will, with UML my feelings have changed.  I think its provision to experiment with designs without investing the effort involved in code is crucial; the ability to scrap a UML design and start over defines its value.  That's right, I said the value UML provides is that it's easily tossed out.  I don't doubt that there may still be some benefits to UML-ing a design and jumping straight from it to code, but the point is that you lose less money by going through a few UML iterations than you do going through a few code iterations.<br &#47;><br &#47;>I submit that if you don't scrap at least one UML design before proceeding to code:  you're missing the point.<br &#47;><br &#47;>If I ran a design group, I would mandate that a design first be proposed to a group of peers (which should be composed of all developers involved in the project) before any code is written.  Peers should be merciless in expressing reservations, concerns, or dislikes of the proposed design.  The proposal meeting should not venture far into proposing solutions, but voicers of dissent should clearly state the grounds for their objection.  <span style="font-style:italic;">Issues<&#47;span> should have a solid basis, but are not required to suggest a solution.</p>
