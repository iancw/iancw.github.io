<p>Microsoft has an incredible advertising team.  Their new "people oriented" thrust is brilliant.  Honestly, I'm seeing Microsoft in a new light.  If they weren't around, you've got to admit, computers would suck.  Our moms would NOT be using them.  Our bosses wouldn't either.  Gamers wouldn't pay thousands for new machines every two years to match the millions that game companies are sinking into development.  We would not have the internet.  Think about it.  And then realise the brilliance of Microsoft's advertising group!  I enjoy spending my free time configuring gentoo to hibernate, sleep, and scroll via mouse wheel.  I'm thrilled that I can control the backlight of my monitor with a simple command.  And thier commercial just made me sit back and say "wow, I'm thankful for microsoft."  If I start a software business, you can bet advertising will be a priority.  <br &#47;>  <br &#47;>What makes it so effective?  Three families waking up, grooming, eating, and travelling to work.  One is Japanese, the others I can only assume are american--possibly european.  Maybe it's must my soft spot the scenes of Japanese everyday life.  The narrow streets.  The businessmen perched on womens bicycles.  Bathing with buckets.  It's a little pathetic, don't you think?   I mean, just because I spent the summer there I'm in love with everything Japanese.  But...my digression post is also digressing.  Lets bring it into line, and to a close, by saying that advertising (or "the full experience") is just as--but not more--important as the quality of the software itself.  I'm not just talking commercials.  I mean icons, install process, documentation, interaction--the whole kit.  I maintain that thirty to fifty percent of Firefox's popularity should be attributed to it's glorious icon.  I use firefox because clicking on that blue and orange beauty is way more fun than clicking on an ugly e.</p>
