<p>From mrjb<br />
<blockquote>Yes, writing software is hard, especially writing good software. The hardest part is to make things simple, even harder is to make things simple AND flexible. The need for a thorough analysis is greatly underappreciated.</p>
<p>Incompetent developers tend to make things more complex than necessary. From that point on, under economic pressure, workarounds are needed to get things done. This in turn makes things even more complex than necessary. THAT is what makes writing software hard. The problem is, it is difficult to be aware of the skills that we lack. As such, a lot of programmers with a huge ego don't deserve one.</p>
<p>I'm not into Extreme Programming per se, but I've noticed that if multiple people look at a piece of software, chances of problems going undetected get smaller and smaller. Yes, even if you, a master programmer, show your code to a rookie, the chance of bugs going undetected will reduce. In fact, it will inevitably result in more bugs being detected before rolling them out to customers.</p></blockquote>
<p>This corroborates my experience to a <i><b>T</b></i>.  I'm thinking especially the second paragraph:  better developers produce simpler code.  Simplicity is our prime directive.</p>
