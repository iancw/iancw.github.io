<p><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_RGOf-1jopDU&#47;SLQLzMLoypI&#47;AAAAAAAABwY&#47;QbUT422FUEM&#47;s400&#47;019.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238825240609999506" &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;><br &#47;>The past few days have been filled primarily with beachy pursuits.  Windsurfing as been the top draw, but today will hopefully be spent lounging in the sand, applying sunblock, and finishing Huck's adventures.  There was a good breeze yesterday and I was able to get the board to plane a little.  I also fell a lot more frequently than Sunday.  <br &#47;>  Here's the low down on nerdy vacation activities.  I found this video series (http:&#47;&#47;www.dimensions-math.org&#47;) about how we can visualize a fourth dimension and watched the first few episodes yesterday morning (to the amusement of my family).  I haven't quite managed to "see" the fourth dimension, but it's interesting nonetheless.  Last night I worked out what I'm pretty sure is a solution to the first euler project problem (http:&#47;&#47;projecteuler.net&#47;index.php?section=problems&id=1) in lisp, but I can't get it to run.<br &#47;><br &#47;>***Warning, spoiler<br &#47;><br &#47;>(defun is-divisible (x y)(eq (mod x y) 0))<br &#47;>(defun sum-multiples(x y z)<br &#47;>(+ <br &#47;>    (sum-multiples x y z) <br &#47;>    (cond<br &#47;>       ((is-divisible z x) z)<br &#47;>       ((is-divisible z y) z)<br &#47;>       (T 0))<br &#47;>))<br &#47;><br &#47;>The error SLIME gives me is below.  I don't see what slime has against x.  It looks like a perfectly good variable to me.<br &#47;><br &#47;>NIL: symbol X has no value<br &#47;>   [Condition of type SYSTEM::SIMPLE-UNBOUND-VARIABLE]<br &#47;><br &#47;>And that's basically been as far as my vacation has advanced nerdom.  I've got some photography in.  I've been doing a series of shots of morning coffee.  Sunday I brought my camera along in the kayak while my sister learned to windsurf.  I made liberal use of the rapid-fire mode and got some good shots.  I've put them on flikr (http:&#47;&#47;www.flickr.com&#47;photos&#47;8499931@N04&#47;2796464444&#47;in&#47;photostream&#47;), and imagine I'll upload them to picasaweb eventually.  Flikr vs picasaweb.  Dillemmas.  I like the photostream idea and the social atmosphere that flikr has.  But the unlimited restriction on the number of sets you can have and the general integration with maps and the picasa photo manager is a big plus for picasa.  <br &#47;><br &#47;><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;farm4.static.flickr.com&#47;3104&#47;2795659629_6559dd592e.jpg?v=0"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px;" src="http:&#47;&#47;farm4.static.flickr.com&#47;3104&#47;2795659629_6559dd592e.jpg?v=0" border="0" alt="" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>Beach time.</p>
