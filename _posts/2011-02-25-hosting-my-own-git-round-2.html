<p>I uploaded the work for that graphics project to my own git server.  Here are a couple of the tricks I learned.</p>
<p>1.  You have to add a file called git-daemon-export-ok in the git directory</p>
<blockquote><p>
cd myrepo.git/<br />
touch git-daemon-export-ok
</p></blockquote>
<p>2.  You can't push to a non-bare git repository, so when you init or clone it, you have to use --bare.</p>
<blockquote><p>
git clone --bare initial-git-repo/ remote-git.git/
</p></blockquote>
<p>(p.s. hg kind of sucks.  It's probably better for the uninitiated windows user, e.g. classmates on group projects, but you inevitably have at least one conflict during the course of a semester, and the conflict resolution is kind of obscure.  Some critical functionality, such as branching, must be done through manual directory duplication.  Super lame.)</p>
