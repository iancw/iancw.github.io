<p>I'm switching carriers, and my old phone was a motorola V195.  I want to get my phone contacts off, but there seems to be no good way to do it with my macs at home and free software.  I refuse to buy something for a one-time chore of moving contacts between phones.  The Wammu/Gammu software might work on linux, but it didn't compile on a first attempt on my mac.</p>
<p>Enter AT commands, which I learned about in my embedded programming class last semester.  It was remarkably easy to get in to the v195!  </p>
<p>Step 1:  Set up a bluetooth connection to the phone.<br />
  Edit the serial ports, set up an RS-232 link.  I'm not sure what the service field does, but leaving it as a network gateway worked.  Change the name to something short and easy to type.</p>

<p>Step 2:  Run mini com</p>
<p>Now you can connect to the serial port using minicom, start it with the -s flag to change configuration before trying to connect.</p>
<blockquote><p>minicom -s</p></blockquote>
<p><img src="/content/2011/12/minicom-config.png"/></p>
<p>  Use baud 9600 with 8N1 and change the name of the serial device to /dev/tty.<what you typed in the name field></p>
<p>Step 3:  Go to town!<br />
  Test the connection by typing AT, you should see an OK back. </p>
<blockquote><p>
AT<br />
OK<br />
AT+CGMI<br />
+CGMI: "Motorola CE, Copyright 2000"<br />
OK<br />
AT+CGMM<br />
+CGMM: "GSM900","GSM1800","GSM1900","GSM850","MODEL=V195"<br />
OK
</p></blockquote>
<p>There's a good description of motorola AT commands <a href="http://www.motorola.com/web/Business/Products/M2M%20Wireless%20Modules/C24%20CDMA%20Wireless%20Module/Document/staticfile/C24%20AT%20commands.pdf">here (pdf)</a>. For my purposes the AT+CPBR=# command is what I was looking for.  </p>
<blockquote><p>
OK<br />
AT+CPBR=1<br />
+CPBR: 1,"###########",129,"Mom"
</p></blockquote>
<p>The number defines which entry in the phone book you need.  Now I just need to write a program that pulls all these down automatically.</p>
