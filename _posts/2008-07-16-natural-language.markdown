<p>I'm fascinated by etymologies.  When I hear a new word I don't know, I'm often compelled to look up both definition and origin.  The other day, while reading the WP <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.washingtonpost.com&#47;wp-dyn&#47;content&#47;article&#47;2008&#47;07&#47;14&#47;AR2008071402445.html">article<&#47;a> on the controversial New Yorker cover, I found a word I hadn't seen before:  "rubesoisie."<br &#47;><br />
<blockquote>Confession:<br &#47;>In fact, I found four words I wasn't immediately familiar with.  It's amusing that an article about an image which is controversial because it requires a level of sophistication in order to not be offensive uses vocabulary that seems uncommonly erudite.  Was it intentional?  Was it a subconscious feeling of superiority over these "rubesoisie" that pulled words down from the very heights of the author's linguistic experience?  Or maybe he just normally uses big words.  Anyway, the other three words were <span style="font-style: italic;">vociferously<&#47;span>, which means "Making a noisy outcry; clamorous; noisy," <span style="font-style: italic;">dudgeon<&#47;span>, which means "a feeling of intense indignation," and <span style="font-style: italic;">anodyne<&#47;span>, which means "a medicine that sooths or eases pain."  Feel free to compare your own linguistic experience with mine and feel superior that you were already plenty familiar with those words.<br &#47;><&#47;blockquote>But let's return to the discussion of "rubesoisie."  A google search for the word revealed only three distinct uses (including the WP article), all of which directly referenced the Post.  "What just happened?", I wondered.  "Has the Post started inventing new words?"  No.  They misspelled a word that <span style="font-style: italic;">someone else<&#47;span> <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.lileks.com&#47;bleats&#47;archive&#47;08&#47;0408&#47;041508.html">invented<&#47;a>, not out of thin air, by inspiration from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.io.com&#47;%7Egibbonsb&#47;mencken.html">Mencken<&#47;a>.  That word is <span style="font-style: italic;">rubeoisie<&#47;span> (rube-wa-zie), it was christened with the definition:  "a God-clinging gun-nut anti-NAFTA fool."  The word is a combination of the terms rube and bourgeoisie.  Rube means "an unsophisticated person from a rural area; a person who is not very intelligent or interested in culture."  Although I've enjoyed humor at the expense of our mountain dwelling friends on many occasions, I was not familiar with the term.  It appeared around the turn of the twentieth century when a large percentage of the rural population is reported to have been named Ruben.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Lileks' ironic francification quietly made its way into the consciousness of a few members of our English speaking collective for the first time on April 15, 2008--tax day.  As of July 15, three months later, the word had only migrated into one google reference in addition to its inaugural use.  It seemed a sad start for the satiric word.  Destined to languish in the minds of a few of Lileks' readers and some individuals who are in favor of God, guns, and borders and were somewhat stung by the coining.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Enter the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.newsweek.com&#47;media&#47;62&#47;new-yorker-cover-obama-michelle-joke-vl.jpg">New Yorker<&#47;a>.  What better word to describe the kind of people who <span style="font-style: italic;">don't get it<&#47;span> than Lileks' new word?  So thought Philip Kennicott, the author of the WP article.  Unfortunately, he didn't quite get the spelling correct.  His proofer didn't catch it either, or was unable to look it up.  It took me five concerted efforts to track down the origin; only as a last resort did I attempt to find related French words by removing letters at random.  I don't blame the proofer for giving up sooner.  And so this poor word made its first leap into the greater consciousness of America...<span style="font-style: italic;">spelled wrong<&#47;span>.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Already, "rubesoisie" has vaulted ahead of the original spelling with four substantive google references.<br &#47;><br &#47;>
