<p>Well, I'm on vacation.  I'll be Spending the week at my uncle's beach house with my fam.  There never seems to be enough time to do everything while on vacation.  I've been meaning to learn a little about website development in hopes of eventually getting a personal photography site underway.  I'm sure there are plenty of easy ways to make beautiful sites without understanding the finer points of JSP's or Ruby on Rails, but I want to use this as an excuse to pull myself out my current state of the web-dev ignorance that I'm a little embarrassed about.  Realistically, that means the site probably won't ever get done.  So that's one thing that was on my vaca todo-queue.<br &#47;>   I'm also trying to learn new languages to keep my skills from being too java-centric.  My current project is becoming familiar with lisp.  Project Euler (http:&#47;&#47;projecteuler.net&#47;) came up in one of my RSS feeds the other day.  It looks like just the ticket for getting knee-deep in lisp.  Working through those problems is another potential vacation time sink.<br &#47;>   Recently I've been following the blogs of a few of the sports photographers in Bejing right now.  Every day the photographers will post four or five of their favorite photographs from the day.  It's pretty interesting to watch; you get to see the "frames" (as they say in the photo biz) that the photographs liked best.  These are usually more visually interesting than what you see in the news.  I'm a fan of the photo-blog format.  And it's inspired me to continue working on my photography even when I'm not taking classes.  Getting a few good shots is another goal-for-the-week.  This morning there was good sun and I played around a little with my morning coffee.  Had difficulty getting the oily reflection in the joe, getting a good frame, and keeping everything properly exposed.  Didn't manage to get anything I'm completely happy with, but here's one of the better ones.  Not so happy with the focus; frustrated with my Canon Pro1's ability to focus close in.  It has a manual focus feature that tries to be cool, but it doesn't approach the control or ease of a basic manual focus SLR lense.<br &#47;><br &#47;><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_RGOf-1jopDU&#47;SLGOMZJqLyI&#47;AAAAAAAABv4&#47;03trXzncMEM&#47;s1600-h&#47;coffee,+quonnie+073.JPG"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="http:&#47;&#47;3.bp.blogspot.com&#47;_RGOf-1jopDU&#47;SLGOMZJqLyI&#47;AAAAAAAABv4&#47;03trXzncMEM&#47;s400&#47;coffee,+quonnie+073.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5238124185169571618" &#47;><&#47;a><br &#47;><br &#47;>   There are a few books I'd like to work through while I have some free time too.  I almost finished Shadow of the Almighty, a collection of Jim Elliot's letters and diary entries put together by his wife after he died.  It's a fascinating look inside his mind.  I've made it further through J. C. Ryle's Holiness than ever before, and I'd like to get the chance to read through a few more chapters while I'm away from work.  To help matters, I picked up The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn last night (which I guess I've never read all the way through) and am enamored at Twain's irreverent narrative.<br &#47;>   I also brough along the NACLO problem set (http:&#47;&#47;www.eecs.umich.edu&#47;~radev&#47;namclo&#47;) for 2007 to work through.  Had a blast working through the 2008 problems and look forward to more bite-sized linguistically-oriented problems to solve.<br &#47;>    And all that is nerdy stuff I can do inside.  I do enjoy just being up here; it's refreshing just hanging out in the house.  But I hope to log some serious time on the sand, in the sun, on the tennis courts, catching up on cardio, and seeing if I can remember how to handle a windsurfer.<br &#47;><br &#47;>Overambitious any?</p>
