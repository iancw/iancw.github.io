<p>Article is here:  http://tuxdeluxe.org/node/122</p>
<p>I find this post, near the bottom, to be very encouraging.</p>
<p>Also, "Know the process"<br />On April 6th, 2007 Anonymous says:</p>
<p>Like it or not, software development has a lot of process, so you might as well learn to like it, or at least take the time to understand the how's and why's of it. Every young developer should read books and articles on software engineering. Every young developer should be starting to understand the actual cost of development, how to gather and validate requirements, risk managment, ways to improve quality, factors that impact maintenance, etc.</p>
<p>There was a recent slashdot article discussing the fact that those job candidates who cannot code, *really* cannot code: they cannot even code fizzbuzz. Well, the same is true of process knowledge: I frequently reject candidates young and old who are unclear on things like the purpose of a release branch, code coverage, or use cases.</p>
<p>If you don't understand the software development process, you will always be limited to just doing little coding tasks given to you by others who do understand software engineering (or worse, those who do not).</p>
