<p>How do you know when the design phase is complete?  The software project I work on uses Extreme programming's rapid iteration style.  For an ideal iteration that means a day or two of what we call use case authoring, a week spent on design, a week and a few days on implementation, and the rest on testing and verification.  Our use cases are actually more like UI requirements specifications; they describe flows of interaction featuring mocked-up GUI diagrams, but not much more.  They pretty much exclusively stick with the C(reate)R(etrieve)U(pdate)D(elete) paradigm.  I'm not thrilled with our use case style, but I should save that for another post.<br &#47;>  I'm nearing the end of a design phase.  That it to say, I've UML diagrammed what I can imagine, and I'm itching to make it tangible in code.  What I'm wonder is whether I've really finished the design stage, or whether I should spend a few more days thinking about it.  Are there  guidelines for quantifying the design process?  My impression from design classes in school is that everybody's trying devise algorithms or formulas for successfull designs.  None of them seemed to click when you got past the general ideas.<br &#47;>  Anyway, I thought I'd float an idea out in blog space to...ferment.  My take on the design process is that you approach it with questions, and design is the process of answering those questions.  The questions are in the designer's head.  They may not even be given words, but they exist in essence; the designer is asking how one idea relates to another, and tries to capture those relations with UML.  The questions are how to make the software design natural, efficient, modular.  Is the design phase over when all those questions are answered?  Should the questions be put into words before beginning to model, and asked during the review?  That would at least provide some cohesion to the process, and a sense of completion when the UML has acomplished what it needed.</p>
